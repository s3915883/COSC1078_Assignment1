					<h2>Myself</h2>
					<p>Hello, my name is Crispin and I graduated high school in 2020 in Tasmania and moved over to Melbourne after taking half a gap year. I am half Khmer and half British, but I was born here in Australia and lived here majority of my life. My pastimes are watching TV shows and sometimes playing video games. I don’t really have any other major hobbies. The reason why I moved from Tasmania to Melbourne was because Tasmania only had 1 university and Melbourne has more employment possibilities in the IT field than Tasmania.</p>
					<h2>Education</h2>
					<p> I was born in the southern part of Tasmania in Hobart but moved up to the northern part in a town called Devonport (where the Spirit of Tasmania lands). I attended Devonport High School and then Don College and graduated in 2020 then moved over to Melbourne. The reason why I took half a gap year was because I wanted to save some money up for the move over and this job opportunity ended before the start of the second semeseter which was a prime opportunity for me.</p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Out of all the subjects at school, IT was the most interesting and enjoyable subject for me. I have always been tech-savvy growing up and always liked trying out new things relating to IT. The future of Information Technology has always been on my mind and the job opportunities seem to be growing every year so I thought it would be a good opportunity to get a job in something I like doing. I have had the opportunity last year to work in a casual job revolving around IT which was a Data Entry position. While working there I was able to expand my knowledge on IT and learn from someone who had done their bachelors of IT. While working there, it had reinforced my interest in IT and helped me choose the BP162 course here at RMIT. The reason why I chose RMIT over other universities was because a couple of my friends moved to Melbourne and recommended RMIT as a good university for IT. The location within the city as well as it them accepting second semester applicants despite covid were the main reasons that I chose this university. My interests within the subject would probably be more towards the cyber security because I believe there are good job opportunities with this new day and age. </p>
					<p>Cyber security has been an interest of mine for a little while because the idea of protecting your online assets and preventing attacks seems like it would not get boring in the workplace. The learning expectations I have from this course would be that I am proficient in multiple coding languages such as Python and Java and have a deep understanding of IT. I would also hope it gives be key technical skills that will be able to grant me job opportunity after completing the course. As well as the key technical skills obtained from the bachelor’s degree, I hope to get some work experience through internships to help me acquire more work-related skills that aren’t covered by the course and will help me moving forward.</p>

				<h1>Ideal Job</h1>

					<a href="https://au.gradconnection.com/employers/datacom/jobs/datacom-2021-datacom-australia-graduate-opportunities-information-technology/"><h2>Cyber Security Analyist</h2></a>
					<h3>As an Information Security Analyst you will analyse, assess and investigate vulnerabilities in an organisation's IT infrastructure</h3>
					<p>After some researching on my ideal job within the cyber security sector, I have come across a job that I find will be most fitting for myself in the future. Some of the problems I faced while finding the job in this area is that half of these jobs require multiple years of experience within the field which I wouldn’t have after finishing this course. I began to filter down the job requirements and look for graduate level jobs within the Melbourne area. I personally don’t have a problem with moving to another state for a job, but I think it would be more convenient if it was in the Melbourne range. </p>
					<p>After looking through the job finding websites, I have found a suitable job that fits my criteria on an ideal job. I found this job on au.gradconnection.com (https://au.gradconnection.com/employers/datacom/jobs/datacom-2021-datacom-australia-graduate-opportunities-information-technology/) and it is a graduate entry job meaning that they are looking for people like me for this position. This would be an ideal job for me because first, it is in Melbourne and other major cities in Australia such as Sydney, Canberra and Brisbane which gives me ample opportunity to pick a place which I like the most and doesn’t seclude me to one state. </p>
					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
					<p>The skills and requirements that I currently possess that fit the job description listed are that I have an Australian Citizenship which is important, and I am studying at an Australian University. I also have several years of work experience under my belt which is good because it states that I need 1.5 relevant experience. I have around 2 years’ experience in an IT related job position. When it comes to the skills, I am a good communicator when it comes to teamwork and working with potential customers, I would also consider myself a highly motivated person with a good attitude towards my co-workers in a team environment.</p>
					<h3>Skills I Need</h3>
					<p>The skills that I need would mostly revolve around the actual cyber security part of the job such as the cybersecurity risk assessments and working with wireless control systems and firewalls. I believe that once my course finishes, I will have these skills ready to bring into the workplace, so I am not that concerned about lacking these skills as of right now. I would also admit that having a creative mindset isn’t a strength of mine because I prefer to stick to the book when working with things and don’t like to risk trying new things specially when it comes to working with company assets. Under the job description, it is listed that this would be a strength for a potential employee, I suppose I would have to work with being more creative throughout my time in the course to help be more confident in that area.  </p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>My learning plan to become fully job ready by the end of 2023 would be focusing on my weaknesses outlined above. How I would do this would be by attempting to apply for internships throughout my time here in order to get hands on experience in the workplace because I believe that internships are very important to get an idea of what goes on in a workplace. To improve on my creativity would be learning through collaboration while asking for advice or feedback. Improving creativity isn’t something that is done overnight so I think it will come to fruition slowly as I develop my skills. I would also consider obtaining a part time job throughout the course duration to help improve my customer service skills and general teamwork while also obtaining experience in a work field.</p>

				<h1>Personality Profile</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">

				<article>
					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
					<p>The <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality">Campaigner Personality Profile</a> looks to be the middle point for everything and seems to encompass both sides while maintaining a balance. I can see why I fit under this personality type because I am an easy going individual who both enjoys social gatherings and having an inner life.</p>
					<h3>Strengths</h3>
					<p>The strengths I have that align with the personality type would be being a good communicator by having something to add to the conversation while also being a good listener. I think this is a good trait to have because communication is the foundation of many things in society and being able to express your opinions and take in what people are saying is important. Another strength underlined is being enthusiastic, I wouldn’t consider myself that enthusiastic about everything but when it comes to my interests then I would certainly want to share it with other people and get their ideas and opinions on the subject Curiosity is another big one for me because I enjoy looking for unique things and being open minded when it comes to going beyond my comfort zone.</p>

					<h3>Team Composition</h3>
					<p>When working in a team structure, I think the biggest strength is the communication because being a good projector and listening is very important to the team’s core and having that easy flow is beneficial to everyone in the team. The personality type states that micromanagement could be an issue for Campaigners, but I would consider myself to laid back to micromanage the whole group. Being inspiring and caring is something that campaigners excel at in a team environment whether they are a team leader of just a member.  I think being able to take criticism and being comfortable with the team is also a good trait to possess.</p>

					<h2>Test Two</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Learning Preferences</p>
					<p>After completing the Learning Preferences test, I am an Auditory/Visual learner). For me I would agree with this entirely because it helps me understand new things by following visually and storing it just like that. I believe I have a better time following spoken instructions in comparison to written ones. This is important because I think you will most of the time get spoken instructions in the workplace and while learning. Being a tactile learner is just something I didn’t do while growing up in school because the “Hands-on” approach didn’t really work the best for me, and I had a better time learning through visual and auditory formats. </p>

					<h2>Test Three</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Big 5 Factors</p>
				<p>The <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/results.php?r=3.3,2.7,3.2,2.5,3.3#_V">Big 5</a>
 test assesses an individual on the Big Five Factor Markers are Extroversion, Emotional Stability, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Intellect/Imagination (openness to experience) </p>
				<p>It can be interpreted from factor one that I seem to be around sixty three percent towards extroversion, I can agree with this because I enjoy social gatherings but also need time to myself every now and then and I think having time to yourself is very important for reflection and just to recharge.</p>
				<p>Factor two seems to be towards the opposite of negative emotionality, what I took from this one is that I am more towards positivity and can remain calm in stressful situations and am able to try and turn it around for the better. </p>
				<p>Factor three is something that I don’t agree with, I don’t understand why it came to this conclusion, but the previous tests are pretty much the opposite of this one. I believe I am friendly and optimistic and more in the range of the fifty to sixty percent range of Factor 3. It states that lower scores are more critical and aggressive towards others but that is something that I refrain from doing.</p>
				<p>Factor four reflects the previous tests, and I can agree with it. Since I only got around twelve percent it says that I am impulsive and disorganised. Being disorganised is something that I mentioned above previously, and I agree with this completely and I can agree that sometimes I make impulsive decisions without thinking about the consequences beforehand. </p>
				<p>Factor five supposes that I prefer to be more traditional and conventional instead of being openness to experience, I don’t really have an opinion on this because I can’t really remember any experiences that shows which way, I prefer but I think I disagree with this supposed trait because I like to try new things and go out of my comfort zone. </p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>The project idea that I am proposing is to create a game through Construct2. This game is aimed around privacy and passwords and will be a 2D interactive game. The aim of the game will be to try and find out the password of someone using hints and looking for key information on their social media accounts. The core idea of this project was from my interest within cyber security and although it doesn’t directly stop cyber security threats, it does help people fight against it by showing them through the game what to look out for. The theme will be set-in present-day times and will be aimed towards a younger audience rather than an older one. The game will be set out in different levels and each level will have a unique character that they will need to try and find their password for. The levels will gradually become more harder with each person having more harder passwords and the hints will be tougher to find. The art style of the game will be simple because I simply am not a good artist so they will be cartoon styled. Construct2 is aimed towards visual programming so having minimal coding experience shouldn’t be an issue for this game but the main problem will be developing the art style of the game and creating everything from scratch. The idea of this project is not just to create a video game but to help educate people on the threats of cyber threats and the best ways to protect your data. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>My motivation for the game creation is that I want to follow a path of cyber security through this course and since there isn’t that many options for me to create a project that will help me excel my ability in that field, I have thought of this instead.  The point of this game is to enlighten the player on how easy it is to find simple passwords for their accounts and on how much privacy they are giving away on social media.  According to The Harris Poll 78% of Gen-Z users use the same password for several online accounts <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/young-people-are-overconfident-with-online-security-survey-suggests/#:~:text=A%20Harris%20Poll%2C%20which%20surveyed,password%20for%20multiple%20online%20accounts">(Harris Poll, 2017)</a>. This game concept is a twist on 2D detective games but has an inner meaning to teach young people about the threats of the internet such as phishing and the consequences of oversharing your privacy. I wanted to develop something to do with cyber security and have a good intention behind it and I believe this perfectly portrays a way to do this. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>The game doesn’t have a name right now, but it will be something along the lines of ‘Cyber Awareness’.  The game plan will have around 5 levels, but each level will have several parts of it. The player will start by getting the person’s name and then going onto social media and searching them up. Clues will be separated around their social media page and it will be up to the player to find them. Each level will have harder clues or minigames that they will need to complete for them to get the hints successfully. I aim to implement important information throughout the levels or after each level which will tell the user about what risks are presented and how to avoid them online. By captivating the player with the video game and then using it to inform them of the risks presented throughout the internet seems like a good way to educate them. </p>
					<p>Since the game is 2D, it will most likely be a point and click game and the hints will be shown around different websites. The hints will vary from difficulty, but each hint will outline mistakes people make in real life. This project should grant me some more knowledge around cyber security as I would research more into common mistakes made by people to inform them through the game. I will admit, I don’t think this project will make me job ready or develop any job-related skills, but the importance is around notifying people of potential risks in an interactive way.</p>
					<p>The controls of the game will be very simple, it will be a point and click game where you are looking at a 2D area and you must find the clues around you. There will be small minigames through the game as well which will not be that hard but will require you to concentrate. The current ideas of the minigames haven’t been set yet but something to do with the arrow keys like a small game of snake through to the end and a minigame where you will click on the small circles that come up. These games would require the player to use precision and accuracy to complete them. The user interface will have a small inventory to store the hints that you obtain throughout the level and maybe a journal to help the player in case they get stuck and need to look back through what they have done. The save game feature will also be a thing but will probably save at the start of each level or part of level because making it whenever would seem a little hard.</p>
					<p>After doing some research, the main ideas that I want to cover would be Australia's top cyber threats for Australia. The main ones would include Phishing which has had an increase recently due to covid-19 and the lockdowns within Victoria. Phishing is commonly linked to impersonation of government facilities and online shopping. Another one would be Adware and Ransomware which is more dangerous than Phishing attacks because it can cause some permanent damage if someone doesn't know what they are doing. These main cyber threats will be included in the foundation of the game and the idea would be to raise awareness through the game by visually showing them.  </p>

					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>Construct2 (Scirra, 2017) will be the main developing tool for the project, with its easy visual programming style it shouldn’t take a lot of prior knowledge to create the foundation of the game. Once the foundation has been made, the big problem will be creating the art for the game which will probably take the longest amount of time. There is a possibility of borrowing some already pre-made things for the map and sounds but it is all dependant on what is available at the time. The reason why I chose Construct2 over other game developing software was because Construct2 focuses on 2D games, I looked at other applications such as Cocos2d (Chukong Technologies, 2010), but it focuses on mobile games. The other game development software seems to be more for advanced games and 3d style games.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>The whole foundation of the game and everything will need to be written from scratch, using a game template doesn’t seem that viable as it will probably cause more problems than just creating one from scratch. It doesn’t look like it is that hard to write the code out and like I said previously, Construct2 is a visual coder and doesn’t require much coding experience to use. To find the basic programming skill isn’t that hard because I am taking an intro to programming course through BP162 so I should have a decent idea of the basics. The main skill that I am missing is the artistic talent to create things so either I will have to work on that over time or just use simple styles.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>The outcome of this project would be having as much information as I can on the main cyber threats that are faced by people through the internet. The goal of this interactive game is to make sure the player comes out knowing how to protect themselves online and to look out for common traps. Even though this video game won’t have a direct impact on phishing and cyber security attacks, it will educate people on how to better protect themselves towards these attacks and make them less effective. </p>
